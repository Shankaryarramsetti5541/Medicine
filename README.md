This project is a Medical Store Management System developed using Python and SQLite.
It is a menu-driven console application that helps manage medicines, billing, orders, transactions, and profit calculation for a medical shop.

The system maintains real-time medicine availability, generates customer bills, tracks sales transactions, manages stock orders, and calculates daily profits.
